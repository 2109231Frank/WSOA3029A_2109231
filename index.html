                <h2>ABOUT</h2>
                <p>This website explores the quality of living in different places on the planet. 
                    The idea behind this is to confront people with the fact that there are many 
                    areas on the globe where people struggle through life and there are other places 
                    where people are born into luxury and safety. Why do I think this is important? 
                    Well, I have spoken to numerous people who are overly pessimistic or optimistic 
                    about the place that they live. I personally become tangled in my own pessimism 
                    sometimes and think that it would be beneficial to have a bit more perspective 
                    with regards to quality of living and the privilege that I actually have.</p>
