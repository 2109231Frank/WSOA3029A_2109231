            <h1>DISSECTING MODEL VISUALS</h1>  
            <article>
                <p>Knaflic shares various graphs and explains why she made them the way that she did. 
                There were key points made with regards to most of the graphs which correlated with 
                one another and thus could be seen as important for data visualization. If you want 
                to share information effectively, your data visualization must be visually accessible. 
                This can be done in many ways, such as: colour choices, font size and placement, graph 
                type and title/label choices (Knaflic, 2015).</p>
                
                <p>While reading this chapter it became clear that one should think about almost every 
                aspect of your graph in order to ensure that the information will be read clearly. 
                Another important design choice is the one that emphasises the point of the graph 
                (the problem or pattern that is being portrayed). As a data visualization designer, 
                you need to constantly keep the viewer in mind, you need to think about how the 
                viewerâ€™s eye will move over the graph and where their eyes will stop and focus. By 
                manipulating this we can portray the narrative we want to portray with our data 
                (Knaflic, 2015).</p>
                
                <p>Knaflic expresses that one should consider every data visualization that is confronted 
                as a learning opportunity. One should look at graphs and the design choices that were 
                made and learn what the designer did right and wrong (Knaflic, 2015). By doing this 
                you will create a vast library of ideas you can implement into your own data 
                visualizations (Knaflic, 2015).</p>
                
                <p>Ultimately a good visual model is clear, simple and was created with the viewer in mind. 
                You should always look at visual models in such a way that you learn something from them. 
                In order to portray narratives with your data you need to have a clear point or pattern 
                with your model and this point needs to be clear to the viewer. In order to make sure your 
                point is clear you can emphasize it or de-emphasize other parts of the model by changing 
                the colour, placement, size etc. of certain of specific parts within the model 
                (Knaflic, 2015).</p>
