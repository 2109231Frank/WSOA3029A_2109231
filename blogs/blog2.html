            <h1>UX & UI ANALYSIS</h1>  
            <article>
                I will be analysing the website Ulwazi seeing that it is the website that I use 
                most days. I will be forming this analysis by looking at the design, UI and UX 
                of Ulwazi’s home page. Below is a screenshot of the home page.
                <br>
                <img class="blogImage" src = "../images/UlwaziHome.png" 
                alt = "Screenshot of my Ulwazi home page showing">
                <br>
                <p>At first glance we see that the home page of Ulwazi looks friendly and simple. 
                The UI (User Interface) looks good, it is clear what you need to click in order 
                to navigate to the desired course. On the right-hand side of the page, we see a 
                list of the most recent announcements, this is a good addition t the page seeing 
                that one can see the most recent notifications from various courses which makes 
                it easy to figure out what to do directly from the home page. On the left of the 
                page are more navigation options that are accompanied by symbols making it easier 
                to figure out where to navigate in order to find the desired web pages. Ultimately 
                the UI of Ulwazi is clean, clear and simple; this is why I believe the UI design is 
                well done.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>The UX (User Experience) refers to the site user’s overall experience when interacting 
                with the website. Whilst using Ulwazi I want to find assignments or tasks that I need 
                to do as well as readings and other files. Finding these things need to be easy seeing 
                that people use this website to do university work and do not want to waste time 
                aimlessly navigating the website in search of the required materials. With this in mind 
                I can say that Ulwazi has good UX design seeing that it is clear where to navigate on 
                the site. There are notifications that show you which course has new files, new 
                assignments/tasks, and new announcements. Using the website is easy and fast, which is 
                exactly what is needed from this type of website.</p>

                <p>In Kidd’s article, Representation Ch1 Theories of Representation, 2015. He notes and 
                discusses various interesting theories on representation with regards to imagery, 
                photography, journalism, politics and the media. Unfortunately, I failed to see how I 
                could relate any of the points made in the article with the home page of Ulwazi.</p>
