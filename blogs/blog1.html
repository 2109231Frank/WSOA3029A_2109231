                Data visualization is the process of changing raw data into information that is represented in a visual form. 
                This data allows viewers to see and understand the patterns and relationships within data which, in  turn,  
                creates  the  possibility  of  informed  decision  making  and  informed  predictions  of  future  data. There 
                are many definitions of data visualisation, but all of them include, to some extent, what I have said above. 
                Data visualization has been around for as long as human beings have been recording history and is essential 
                for understanding raw data and what that data means. This has resulted in a massive amount of invention and 
                discovery throughout history (Crapo, Waisel, Wallace, & Willemain, 2000). Since computer technologies have 
                been introduced into the equation, data visualisation has become a lot easier to manifest since we no longer 
                have to hand draw charts etc. to represent data: instead, we can use  algorithms  and  various  computer  
                software  to  do  this  for  us  (Friendly,  2009).  Traditional  data visualisation is focused on the 
                communication for understanding data rather than any other approaches, and this type of data visualisation 
                has a number of advantages. These advantages include:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>It has the ability to visually represent a vast amount of data immediately.</li>
                    <li>It  enables  viewers  or  analysts  to  immediately  view  emergent  patterns  within  
                        the  data  which allows them to formulate new insights.</li>
                    <li>It can be used for product quality control seeing that 
                        the identification of problems are revealed almost immediately through data analysis.</li>
                    <li>It improves the understanding of large- and small-scale data.</li>        
                </ul>
                <br>
                 The reason for the importance of data visualisation is, simply put, that it allows us 
                to see and understand patterns  and  relationships  within  data,  which  is  crucial  to  a  variety  of  important  
                decisions  within businesses etc. Data and information go hand in hand and the definitions on both of these concepts 
                vary, but generally “data” refers to information that is raw and unprocessed. “information” refers to processed and 
                usable data.There  are  two  forms  of  data,  namely:  primary  and  secondary  data.  Primary  data  refer  to  
                data  that  is collected directly from the units or individual correspondents for the purpose of information studies. 
                Secondary data is information within data which is processed or analysed in order to extract information for various
                purposes (Agarwal, 2006, p3). From the above information we can assume that primary data is raw data and secondary 
                data is information. There are many forms or techniques of data visualisation that  depend  on  the  data  and  its 
                form.  It  is  up  to  the  data  and  their  form  to  dictate  which  type  of visualisation will be used in order 
                to analyse said data.Ultimately data visualisation has been around for a very long time and is as important as ever. 
                The only changes to data visualisation that have ben made and probably will be made in the future is how it is data 
                is processed and analysed in order to create information that can be used in a visual form. These visual forms are 
                dictated by the type of data that is being used and there are many to choose from.
