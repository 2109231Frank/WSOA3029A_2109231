            <h1>MY REPRESENTATION AND COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES</h1>  
            <article>
                <p>
                    The data visualization that I have decided to make interactive is my pie chart. My strategy 
                    for doing this is adding more data sets that the user can choose from, allowing the user to 
                    view a pie chart representing the different qualities of living in the city of their 
                    choosing. I have chosen to communicate the data sets through a pie chart since pie charts 
                    are simple and easy to understand in my opinion. The chart will clearly represent the score 
                    of each quality of living aspect of the different cities. The user will be able to switch 
                    between the cities using buttons seeing that this is the simplest way I could think of to 
                    create this interaction. This was however the original idea, adly I could not get it to 
                    work. Thus I settled for letting the user hover over the pie chart to make the legend appear.

                    Riche et al. in their book, <i>Data Driven Storytelling</i>, chapter 9 explains some strategies and 
                    good practices for communicating data to audiences. One of these good practices or strategies is having 
                    a consistent design approach, which refers to having a consistent style so that audiences or users to 
                    relate in a sense to the work which could encourage them to return. This consistent style refers to fonts, 
                    colours, layout, and types of interaction (Riche et al., 2018; pp. 219-220). This stood out to me and 
                    helped me focus my designs towards a single style and colour scheme. I will continue to do this in order 
                    to keep communication with users clear.

                    Evanthia Dimara, and Charles Perin in their paper, <i>What is Interaction for Data Visualization</i>, 
                    describe one aspect of good interaction that they have found through their research. This aspect is simple 
                    interaction over minimal information. They also state that good interaction is direct and simple in order 
                    to improve the user’s understanding of the data that is being represented (Dimara and Perin, 2020). What I 
                    understand by this is that when designing interaction with regards to data visualization one must keep in 
                    mind that overstimulating the user with too much power in terms of interaction or an over-abundance of 
                    information that will leave the user overwhelmed. It is for this reason why I focused my strategy of 
                    designing my interaction and communication on keeping everything simple and clear. This goes hand in 
                    hand I believe seeing that decreasing the amount or depth of you information would allow you to focus 
                    more on how the left over data (so to speak) is going to be represented. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ultimately, I’m not going to give the user too much different interactions that might distract or 
                    overwhelm them, this allowed me to focus on simple representation of my data (each pie chart segment 
                    represents an aspect of the quality of life in Dar Es Salaam). The data set that I have chosen from the start have already been filtered by myself 
                    before implementing them into the data visualizations. The reason that I decided to do this was to 
                    simplify the visualizations and ensure that the amount of data that is being represented isn’t overwhelming 
                    and that the graphs aren’t littered with data that is mundane and uninteresting, thus creating simple but effective communication and representation.
