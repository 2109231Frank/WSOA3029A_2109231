            <h1>REFLECTION ON DATA-DRIVEN ART</h1>  
            <article>
                <p>
                    This blog post’s question was, “Critical reflection on the representation and 
                    communication strategies you used in your Data-Driven Artwork. Explain what you 
                    wanted to achieve and how you went about it.”, that being said; the brief for this 
                    assignment didn’t require me to make any data-driven art. Thus, I have decided to 
                    reflect on the data driven artwork that I have looked at in the previous blog post.
                </p>
                <p>
                   <i> Every Playboy Centerfold, The Decades</i> (normalized) (2002), by Jason Salavon 
                   is an art piece that was created by taking every Playboy centerfold over the decades 
                   in order to make a mean average of the decade’s centerfolds. I will not be adding a 
                   picture of this artwork seeing that I already did in the previous blog post.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jason used pixel manipulation and averaging in order to represent every Playboy 
                    centerfold for the 1960’s, 1970’s, 1980’s, and the 1990’s. the strategy here was to 
                    average out the colour pixels of the centerfolds in order to create an average centerfold 
                    that would ultimately show how the models’ skin tone, hair colour, and body shape has 
                    changed over the years (possibly due to audience taste changing). This strategy, as 
                    explained in my previous blogpost, isn’t a new strategy seeing that it has been used 
                    often in facial recognition software, according to Viégas and Wattenberg.

                    Communication is a very important aspect of data visualization; thus, we can assume 
                    that it is just as important for data-driven artwork. According to Riche et al. in Data 
                    Driven Storytelling one great strategy for good communication is consistency. For this 
                    particular art piece, we can see that Jason manipulated the colour pixels in such a way 
                    that all of the Playboy centerfolds throughout the decades have a similar look and feel 
                    to them. For instance, the backgrounds of the pictures are all a blueish shade. This 
                    strategy results in models themselves standing out as well the changes in model type 
                    across the decades.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe that the point or commentary that Jason wanted to portray with this artwork 
                    was that people’s taste in women have changed rapidly between the 1960’s and the 1990’s, 
                    and that Playboy has picked their models accordingly. That being said I am can not 
                    possibly know whether this speculation is true or not, it is just my interpretation of 
                    the art. How Jason achieved this is by creating a mean average of the centerfolds while 
                    manipulating the colours in order to make the backgrounds seem similar, putting more 
                    emphasis on the differences between the averages between the four decades. To reiterate, 
                    these are merely how I understand the artist’s work with regards to his goals  and 
                    strategies.
