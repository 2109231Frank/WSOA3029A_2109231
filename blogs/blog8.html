            <h1>WHAT IS INTERACTION FOR DATA VISUALIZATION?</h1>  
            <article>
                <p>
                    In <i>What is Interaction for Data Visualization</i> Evanthia Dimara and Charles Perin attempt 
                    to clear the confusion with what “interaction” means with regards to data visualization. 
                    Dimara and Perin suggest that this confusion is caused by a lack of consensual definition. 
                    The goal of their reading is to improve the understanding of interaction within data 
                    visualization in order to enrich interactive design practices within data visualization 
                    (Dimara and Perin, 2020).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through research and collaboration Dimara and Perin have derived what the initial understanding 
                    of interaction within visualization. From the research they have found mandatory components of 
                    interaction. These components are external and internal entities and actions. The internal entity 
                    of interaction is the intent behind the data which is identified at a low level (alter the 
                    representation of data) and a higher level (information seeking, sensemaking, and knowledge 
                    acquisition/creation). The external entities were found to be the user (the human being interacting 
                    with the visualization) and the data (the information source that is the main interest of the user). 
                    The external actions refer to the user performing an action on the visualization system and that 
                    system returns a reaction in the form of “permutation of graphical marks, change of transformation 
                    parameters, and alteration of the pipeline”. The internal actions refer to the user performing 
                    cognitive acts or performing a reasoning process on the data in order to interact with the 
                    visualization. The above mentioned components of interactivity are not the only components that 
                    interactivity can include, but are mandatory for interactivity, I will however not be going through 
                    the possible extra internal and external entities and actions (Dimara and Perin, 2020).

                    Dimara and Perin also researched the different benefits and critiques surrounding 
                    interaction. The benefits are that interaction increases the human ability to explore 
                    and understand data. The critiques pointed out that research efforts often consider 
                    interaction an afterthought rather than focusing on it in comparison to data representation 
                    (Dimara and Perin, 2020).

                    Ultimately in the visualization field interactivity refers to the dialogue between user 
                    and visualization system over a central object of interest (data that is being visualized 
                    in this case). This is however, not universally agreed upon and thus Dimara and Perin 
                    decided to look at what interaction means within the HCI field (Human-Computer Interaction). 
                    Interaction within HCI is also considered to be a dialogue between user and computer, however 
                    in HCI there are more properties that are seen as important for interaction, such as: 
                    simplicity with minimal information, user experience, and user embodiment 
                    (Dimara and Perin, 2020).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ultimately through research and consideration, Dimara and Perin have created their own 
                    definition of interaction within visualization: “Interaction for visualization is the 
                    interplay between a person and a data interface involving a data-related intent, at 
                    least one action from the person and an interface reaction that is perceived as such” 
                    (Dimara and Perin, 2020; p. 8).
