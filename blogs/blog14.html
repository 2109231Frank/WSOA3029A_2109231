            <h1>REFLECTION ON MY DATA-DRIVEN ART</h1>  
            <article>
                <p>
                    For my data driven artwork I decided to take my data set, which presents the quality 
                    of life in Johannesburg by giving certain aspects of life a score out of 10. I gave 
                    each of these aspects a specific colour depending on their score. Everything above 5 
                    had a shade of blue because I believe that blue represents calmness, safety, and health. 
                    All the aspects with a score of 4 and below had a shade of red, seeing that red for me 
                    represents fire, anger, and danger. The aspects that have a score of 5 was purple, which 
                    is a mix between blue and red thus making it a good “middle-ground” colour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I decided to change some of the aspects’ scores because I don’t agree with a few of 
                    them. For instance, Diepsloot, Alexandria and Soweto are part of Johannesburg, and these 
                    areas (apart from Soweto mostly) are known to be plagued by assault, rape, mugging, and 
                    other criminal activities. The original data gave Johannesburg 5/10 for safety and 8/10 
                    for housing (just to name a few), and these scores I altered slightly to portray how I 
                    personally as well as a number of people I have consulted experience Joburg. After 
                    speaking to some people who live in these areas, I decided that for my artwork I wanted 
                    to portray the dangers that some of Joburg’s residents go through while others blissfully 
                    live in relative peace and safety. I wanted my art to represent how less-privileged 
                    people view Johannesburg, admittedly I can’t know whether my portrayal is accurate seeing 
                    that I am privileged enough to live in a nice area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final artwork that I made required mixing (in a sense) all the aspects’ colours to 
                    make the “colour of Joburg”. I put this colour on a canvas and put a silhouette of the 
                    Johannesburg skyline in front of it to complete the art. As a photographer I understand 
                    the power of pictures and the feelings that colour can make people feel. After finishing 
                    my artwork, I believe that my artwork represents Johannesburg’s true colours (the fact 
                    that the final colour is red-leaning means that there are much more bad aspects about 
                    Johannesburg than good ones). I might have had a bit of a bias while creating this piece 
                    seeing that I am personally pessimistic with regards to the city seeing that I have heard 
                    and seen many terrible things while living here and I personally struggle to see 
                    improvement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Initially I thought this personal opinion/bias would be a problem, but after visiting Fernanda B. Viégas and 
                    Martin Wattenberg’s paper, <i>Artistic Data Visualization: Beyond Visual Analytics</i> (2007) 
                    again I realized that data driven art or artistic data visualization is visualization 
                    that expresses the point of view of the artist (Viégas and Wattenberg, 2007). Thus, I 
                    believe that me expressing my own feelings and how I personally see Joburg is in line with what 
                    data driven art is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With regards to interaction, I referred back to <i>What is Interaction for Data Visualization</i> 
                    (2020) by Evanthia Dimara, and Charles Perin. Dimara and Perin explain various components 
                    of interaction that they have found through cross referencing and research. They also state 
                    that interaction within the Human-Computer Interaction field relies on simplicity, minimal 
                    information, user experience, and user embodiment (Dimara and Perin, 2020). They ultimately 
                    came up with their own working definition of interactivity within data visualization that I 
                    have kept in mind while making this art piece. Their definition is: “Interaction for 
                    visualization is the interplay between a person and a data interface involving a data-related 
                    intent, at least one action from the person and an interface reaction that is perceived as 
                    such” (Dimara and Perin, 2020; p. 8).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking at the above definition I believe that my artwork is interactive: the user will start 
                    a dialogue/interplay with my piece by looking at it with an initial opinion or view regarding 
                    Johannesburg, this is the user’s action, the reaction from my work is that it will try to 
                    invoke some kind of emotion from the reader, it will actively try and get my point across 
                    which would either disagree with the users initial view or reinforce it. The fact that the colour 
                    that is being portrayed as leaning towards a red spectrum will portray the overall 
                    message/intent of the artwork (showing the user that Johannesburg is struggling on many fronts) 
                    and ultimately give the artwork its meaning. This dialogue between the user and my art is proof
                    (I believe) that my data driven art is interactive, and is in line with the definition of 
                    interaction that I was taught this semester.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to Knaflic’s <i>Storytelling with Data</i> Chapter 6 a good visual model is one that is made 
                    with the user in mind, and in order to use visual models to portray a narrative there must be a 
                    point that is clear to the user. To improve the clarity of this point you can emphasize it 
                    through colour, size, placement, etc. (Knaflic, 2015). Looking at what Knaflic said I believe 
                    that my data driven art is a good visual model seeing that designed it in such a way that it 
                    would stand out from the website with its black silhouette and 
                    dark reddish background. This was done to emphasize my point. I had the user in mind throughout 
                    the process of making my art: I designed the website to be easy on the eyes and calming with its 
                    soft blue colours, I thought that if the user navigated through the website, it would make them 
                    feel a certain way which would shift almost immediately when interacting with my artwork, ultimately 
                    driving home the point of view that I am trying to portray with my art.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, I believe that my artwork is interactive since it does have an interplay with the user. 
                    It is a good visual model since it emphasises my point and tries to tell a narrative about living in 
                    Johannesburg, and finally I believe that manipulating the piece slightly to share my personal views and 
                    experiences is in line with what data driven art is and what it is usually used for.
