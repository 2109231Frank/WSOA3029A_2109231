            <h1>ANALYSIS OF DATA-DRIVEN ARTWORK</h1>  
            <article>
                <p>
                    The data driven art that I will be looking at in this blog post is Every Playboy 
                    Centerfold, The Decades (normalized) (2002) by Jason Salavon. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <img class="blogImage" src = "../images/EveryPlayboyCenterfold.jpg" 
                alt = "Infographic showing cases of data breaches throughout history.">
                <br>
                <p>
                    The above image is the data driven art by Jason Salavon and is labelled 1960’s to 1990’s 
                    from left to right. According to Jason Salavon’s own website he describes that the 
                    photographs used in the art piece are the result of overlaying the mean average of 
                    Playboy’s centerfolds throughout the decades between the 1960’s and the 1990’s.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The artistic strategy that Jason has incorporated was averaging the colour pixels in each 
                    decade making it seem like the Playboy models’ skin tones become lighter as well as their 
                    hair colour. Ultimately showing how audience taste has changed over the years. This 
                    strategy isn’t too unique as explained by Viégas and Wattenberg in their paper, Artistic 
                    Data Visualization: Beyond Visual Analytics, where they explain that this strategy is 
                    often used in facial recognition algorithms. Jason has manipulated the colour pixels in 
                    the images and rearranged them to create meaning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The meaning that Jason created through manipulating the mean average of Playboy’s 
                    centerfolds is that Playboy’s audience’s taste has changed over the decades to preference 
                    women with blonder hair, lighter skin tones, and thinner figures. What stands out the 
                    most to me about this project is how Jason managed to turn hundreds of unique models into 
                    and average blurry model, I can not say what Jason wanted to portray with this project 
                    and thus these points are merely speculation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In full, I think that through Jason’s artistic strategy led to his project created the 
                    meaning that through the decades Playboy’s ideal model have become slimmer, whiter, and 
                    blonder. Why Jason thought that this was important is lost on me, but I do find how he 
                    portrayed this to be interesting.
