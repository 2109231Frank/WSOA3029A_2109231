            <h1>INFORMATION IS BEAUTIFUL</h1>  
            <article>
                <p>
                    The data visualization that I have chosen to analyse is the infographic showing 
                    “Coronavirus Riskiest Activities”:
                </p>
                <br>
                <img class="blogImage" src = "../images/COVID-19_infographic.png" 
                alt = "Infographic showing risky activities with regards to Covid-19">
                <br>
                <p>
                    I will be analysing this data visualization in terms of the communication and 
                    representational strategies that the designer used. First, I shall look at the 
                    representational strategies. According to Kidd, representational texts such as 
                    images (icons in this case) do not just capture reality. They should help shape 
                    it within the given frame. He also mentions that representational texts/images 
                    can be manipulative depending on which ones you decide to use (Kidd, 2015). 
                    Looking at the icons in the infographic (the coloured circles wherein the 
                    activities are written) we can see that they are pretty simple. They have various 
                    sizes and colours. The colours are all warm colours which make the entire 
                    infographic feel uniform and complete. It is clear that the redder colours, the 
                    riskier the activity this is further supported by the fact that the riskier 
                    activities are represented in bigger circles along with heavier text. These 
                    representational choices are effective seeing that the icons that represent the 
                    data are styled in such a way that it is clear what risk level the different icons 
                    are representing. Overall, the representational strategies resulted in clear and 
                    effective representation of the data, I think that the representational choices 
                    effectively shared the desired information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I shall look at the communication strategies. I appreciate the use of text, 
                    there is very little text in the infographic and is spread out between activity 
                    names within the coloured icons, risk factors to consider, and extra information 
                    or guidelines that accompany some of the activity bubbles. The communication 
                    choices resulted in a clear and easy to digest infographic which is perfectly 
                    suited to the topic seeing that people need to keep these risky activities as well 
                    as the accompanying guidelines, this means that this information needs to be clear 
                    and easy to read.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ultimately, I believe the representational and communication strategies in the 
                    infographic are well planned out and executed seeing that it is a simple, straight 
                    forward, appealing to look at, and the information is easy to digest. I believe 
                    that this is an example of well planned out and executed data visualization that 
                    is sharing important information.
