            <h1>HISTORICAL DATA VISUALIZATION</h1>  
            <article>
                <p>Clive Thompson explains in The Surprising History of the Infographic that our society 
                has become used to data visualization. If you, for example, go to any news website you 
                will probably find infographics detailing political support to the various running 
                parties (during election times). Thompson continues to explain that data visualization 
                is not a new invention; in fact, people have been using imagery to cut through the dense 
                data that they have to work with throughout history (Thompson, 2016).</p>
                
                <p>Thompson explains that data visualization has created a new type of citizen; a citizen 
                that is educated with statistical thinking. Clive provides a number of examples of data 
                visualizations throughout history and the effect of this way of displaying information. 
                It is quite clear that data visualization is an important aspect of society seeing that 
                it can take massive amounts of data and display it in a way that blatantly points out 
                underlying issues with certain subjects. Data visualization thus provide the needed data 
                for certain important decisions/changes in such a way that anybody can see why the 
                decisions/changes need to be made (Thompson, 2016). For example, the graph that Florence 
                Nightingale made with regards to the causes of death in the Crimean War:</p>
                <br>
                <img class="blogImage" src = "../images/3_nightingale-mortality.jpg" 
                alt = "Infographic detailing the mortality causes in the Crimean War, by Florence Nightingale. Image from: https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/best-beautiful-data-visualization-examples">
                <br>
                <p>When looking at the above infographic that Nightingale made in the mid 1800â€™s we can see 
                that the death rate of soldiers was climbing rapidly, and not just because of combat; 
                Instead, soldiers were dying because of their horrible living conditions and the poor 
                healthcare that they received on the front line. The dark wedges are deaths in combat, 
                the reddish wedges represent deaths caused by wounds (received in combat), and the light 
                grey/blue wedges represent deaths caused by various diseases (most of which could have 
                been avoided with proper living and healthcare conditions (Tableau.com, n.d.). One can 
                imagine that thanks to Nightingale it was a lot easier to take the appropriate steps in 
                order to protect the soldiers or to prevent any more unnecessary deaths.</p>
                
                <p>This is just one example of historical data visualization that blatantly shows the 
                importance of presenting data in a way that anyone can understand it. Without creating 
                digestible/usable information from the mass of raw data out there in the world; there 
                would be no way of sharing statistics effectively with the public and it would take an 
                immensely long time to make certain important (life or death) decisions or changes. 
                Ultimately the importance of proper data visualization has always been obvious and data 
                visualization can only help humanity moving forward.</p>
