            <h1>MY UX & UI</h1>  
            <article>
                <p>My website for this semester is supposed to be a clean and simple website. UX or user 
                experience is basically the users overall experience when using something. My website 
                is going to be made with very basic UX in mind. There will be minimal web pages in order 
                to make navigation within the website easier to the user. Kidd’s reading on representation 
                explains the relationship between representation and meaning. The most important tool or 
                agent of representing reality (our view of reality) is language (Kidd, 2015). I feel like the 
                language I should use must portray the reality that my data represents.</p>
                
                <p>UI or User Interface refers to the overall look of the site. My website will utilize basic colours 
                and the styles throughout the pages will be minimalistic. I will try to keep the colours of my 
                website basic and dark while adding minimal soft contrasts so that it does not hurt the user’s eyes. I 
                feel like the website will look good. I’m not planning to make the website overly complicated seeing 
                that I think it will take away from the narrative I will be trying to portray.</p>
                
                <p>Looking back to Kidd’s reading I realise that my website will have to focus on representing reality 
                and I will have to express why I think this narrative is an important one to tell. Going forward I 
                feel like I should focus on representing my character/narrative more seeing that my character felt 
                more like an afterthought in my previous website. What I am planning to keep is the colours and 
                styles since I liked the clean and simple look of my website, however I do feel like adding a bit 
                more interesting components would be beneficial.</p>
                
                <p>Ultimately, I believe that the UX and UI of my website will work relatively well. I think that I was 
                lacking in the UX in my previous website seeing that the website was not particularly interesting 
                while making it feel like an assignment instead of the website of my character. The UI on the other 
                hand I think was done well seeing that it was neat and simple, thus making the website simple and 
                easy to use by most people. I will try to keep the same UI structure as my previous website. Kidd’s 
                reading has made me realise that one should always consider what you want to represent and how you 
                plan to do that and thus I should focus on representation when working on this project.</p>
