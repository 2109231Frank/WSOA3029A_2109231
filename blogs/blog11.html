            <h1>ARTISTIC DATA VISUALIZATION: BEYOND VISUAL ANALYTICS</h1>  
            <article>
                <p>
                    This blog post is a close reading and reflection on Fernanda B. Viégas and Martin 
                    Wattenberg’s paper, Artistic Data Visualization: Beyond Visual Analytics (2007). 
                    This paper looks at the field of information visualization and how the ability to 
                    create data visualizations at home have changed the field from being strictly scientific 
                    to being artistic in a sense.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They first take on the task of defining what can be regarded as artistic data 
                    visualization. This task is an immensely difficult one in on itself seeing that 
                    in order to define exactly what artistic data visualization is one must define what 
                    art is. Viégas and Wattenberg simplified this task by giving a brief definition of what 
                    artistic data visualization is with regards to their paper, and this working definition 
                    is that artistic data visualizations are visualizations created by artists with the 
                    purpose of creating art. Along with this definition Viégas and Wattenberg have devised 
                    a few conditions for what can be considered artistic data visualization: the artworks 
                    must be based on actual data, unlike some artists like Simon Patterson who used 
                    diagrammatic imagery as a base for his artworks, Great Bear and J.P.233 in C.S.O. 
                    Blue. According to Viégas and Wattenberg this is not data visualization since there 
                    is no mapping between data and image. The second condition is that beautiful scientific 
                    visualizations can not be considered artistic data visualization seeing that they do not 
                    align with the working definition that Viégas and Wattenberg have created 
                    (Viégas and Wattenberg, 2007).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Viégas and Wattenberg provide descriptions of four examples of artistic data 
                    visualization in order to aid in the understanding of the issue raised by artistic 
                    data visualization. These examples were chosen for the purpose of highlighting the a 
                    few of the central qualities of artistic visualization (Viégas and Wattenberg, 2007).
                </p>
                <p>
                    All four of these examples share a characteristic according to Viégas and Wattenberg, 
                    which is that they all embody a forceful point of view. The artists responsible for the 
                    examples have committed various visual analytic sins while creating their visualizations. 
                    These so called sins refer to the artists exploiting various mechanisms, pitfalls, or 
                    distortions in order to manipulate audiences towards a certain point of view or 
                    conclusion. These artistic visualizations get their power from the artist’s 
                    understanding of visualization with regards to portraying a certain point of view. 
                    This is vastly different from traditional or scientific visualizations seeing that 
                    traditional visualizations avoid or minimize distortions in order to keep the data 
                    analysis unbiased and dispassionate. Viégas and Wattenberg point out that this might 
                    be misguided seeing that it isn’t possible to create a visualization that is completely 
                    neutral. Viégas and Wattenberg propose a possible solution to this dilemma: they state 
                    that visualization designers should choose an appropriate point of view and make it known 
                    rather than avoiding a point of view all together (Viégas and Wattenberg, 2007).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ultimately, what I took from this paper is that we can learn a thing or two from artistic 
                    visualization. It shows us that visualization can be used to analyse or express a specific 
                    point of view and that avoiding this is not the way to go about designing visualization, 
                    as a designer you should rather understand your bias or choose an appropriate point for 
                    the visualizations that you are creating. The main question that I found throughout this 
                    paper is: should data visualization focus on neutral analysis of data or should designers 
                    explore ways to use visualization in order to support or share a certain point of view.
