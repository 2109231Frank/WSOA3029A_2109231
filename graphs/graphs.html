                <h2>REFLECTION ON MY GRAPHS</h2>
                <p>
                    The strategy behind my graphs was aimed at sharing data in a simple and clear way. 
                    I did not want to overcomplicate my graphs with fancy graphics or weird graph types. 
                    I decided on a bar chart and two pie charts (one of which is my interactive chart) almost immediately seeing that they ar the only graphs I have 
                    ever worked with in the past. That being said I do plan on broadening my experience 
                    by playing around with other graphs in the future. My graphs are indeed simple 
                    (which is what I wanted) but seem a little boring unfortunately. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My representational strategy boils down to my goal to share my data in the simplest 
                    way possible. The orange colours have a nice contrast with the website’s background, 
                    thus making the charts clear and easy to read. I rounded the data to the nearest 
                    integer in order to make each of the bars stop on a number so that it is easier to 
                    mark at what height they are, this luckily did not have a hige impact on the pie chart 
                    since it works ith percentages. Kidd explained that representation is a very important 
                    part of communicating information and that it should embody the data that is being 
                    represented in such a way that it shapes the represented reality in the given frame 
                    (Kidd, 2015). I don’t think that my representation of the data is particularly 
                    interesting, but I do think it is somewhat effective seeing that the bars effectively 
                    show how positive or negative the various aspects of each city is while the segments of 
                    the pie chart clearly show which aspects of New York City are its best aspects. Looking at both the 
                    charts at the same time we clearly see the representation of the difference between both 
                    city’s quality of living. Ultimately, I believe that my representation was successful 
                    but could be much better moving forward.

                    The communication of my graphs basically just wanted to share the quality of various 
                    aspects of life within Johannesburg and New York City. I believe that my graph is 
                    successful in communicating which aspect of life each bar/segment represents and how good or bad 
                    that aspect is, however looking at my bar I cannot think of much else to say which just 
                    justifies my opinion that the graphs are boring and could be improved in future. Looking 
                    at the <i>Communicating Data to an Audience</i> reading we see that a infographic designer needs 
                    to keep two main questions in mind: “What does the audience know?”, and “What does the 
                    audience want?” (al., 2018). Keeping these in mind I decided which aspects I would include 
                    in my graphs (seeing that my API provides information on 17 different aspects of living 
                    in each city). I decided to include aspects that not only matter while living in each city, 
                    but also while just visiting them. I did this because I believe that people who do not live 
                    in these two cities would also be looking at the graphs and they would not exactly care 
                    about aspects such as: “Business Freedom”, “Start-ups”, or “Venture Capital”. I also thought 
                    that some of the most important aspects that audiences would want to know about were things 
                    like: “Safety”, “Commute”, “Tolerance”, and “Leisure & Culture”.

                    My interactive graph was supposed to be much more than what it ended up being: I wanted
                    the user to be able to manipulate the data set with interaction but after working 7AM to
                    3AM for several days I could not figure out how to do this. I have tried working with different graphs 
                    to see whether that coud help fix my problems: unfortunately it did not. Thus I settled for simple interaction 
                    where the user can hover over the chart for a little animation and the reveal of the lables of each segment.
                    I did this in order to let the user look at the pie chart to get a general idea of the quality of life in Dar Es Salaam 
                    without knowing the particualar aspects of this quality of life initially. If the user wanted more detail about 
                    the different aspects contained in the chart they can simply hover their mouse over the chart or click on it
                    if they are looking at it on mobile.
                </p>

                    My final interactive data visualization (which I placed at the top of this page) is a bubble chart. 
                    I am embarrassed to admit that like my previous interactive graph I have bit off more than i can chew:
                    my initial idea for this graph was to let the user move the bubbles around, the bubbles would return back
                    to their original positions after the user lets go of the bubble, the bubbles would have been blanks and the 
                    label of the selected bubble (the one that the user is moving around) would appear while being dragged. This was however very difficult to figure
                    out, and I decided to settle for simple interaction. The user can look at the bubbles that represent the 
                    different aspects of life of the city, Auckland, in New Zealand. The bubbles vary in size depending on the 
                    aspect's score that they represent. When the user hovers over (or taps on in mobile view) a bubble it will 
                    swell in size and labels will fill the chart revealing the the names and scores of each bubble. When the 
                    user moves the mouse off of a bubble (or taps off of it in mobile view) the bubble will shrink a bit and the 
                    outer border of the bubble will become a bit thicker. The reason for the bigger border and the bubble not reverting 
                    back to its original size is so that the user can see which bubbles they already checked, I also wanted to show
                    the user how good Auckland's quality of life is (I found that Auckland is ranked number 1 best city in the world), 
                    and I believe that after all the bubbles have been checked and changed that the chart as a whole would would look 
                    big and aesthetically pleasing which would represent how good the city is. The reason why I chose this city to represent 
                    is because in my previous interactive chart I represented one of the worse cities in the world, and I wanted to 
                    show the contrast between the two. Before the user touches any of the charts they can get a blank idea of the chart, 
                    but after the user hovered over all of the bubbles they will have understood what each bubble represents and the 
                    new look of the chart will represent how good the city supposedly is to live in. Ultimately what I'm trying to do 
                    with this graph is to show contrast between the best city to live in, and the worst, to show people the gap 
                    between the two. I might be idealistic, but I'm hoping that when being confronted by this it might spark some 
                    sort of change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ultimately, I feel that my charts are effective in communicating the information that I wanted 
                    to share. That being said I think that they could have been a bit more interesting if I could 
                    figure out how to use D3 more effectively. In future I will be sure to research more interesting 
                    ways to use D3 and SVG’s as well as look at more examples of data visualization.
