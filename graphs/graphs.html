                <h2>REFLECTION ON MY GRAPHS</h2>
                <p>
                    The strategy behind my graphs was aimed at sharing data in a simple and clear way. 
                    I did not want to overcomplicate my graph with fancy graphics or weird graph types. 
                    I decided on a bar chart and a pie chart almost immediately seeing that they ar the only graphs I have 
                    ever worked with in the past. That being said I do plan on broadening my experience 
                    by playing around with other graphs in the future. My graphs are indeed simple 
                    (which is what I wanted) but seem a little boring unfortunately
                </p>
                <p>
                    My representational strategy boils down to my goal to share my data in the simplest 
                    way possible. The orange colours have a nice contrast with the website’s background, 
                    thus making the charts clear and easy to read. I rounded the data to the nearest 
                    integer in order to make each of the bars stop on a number so that it is easier to 
                    mark at what height they are, this luckily did not have a hige impact on the pie chart 
                    since it works ith percentages. Kidd explained that representation is a very important 
                    part of communicating information and that it should embody the data that is being 
                    represented in such a way that it shapes the represented reality in the given frame 
                    (Kidd, 2015). I don’t think that my representation of the data is particularly 
                    interesting, but I do think it is somewhat effective seeing that the bars effectively 
                    show how positive or negative the various aspects of each city is while the segments of 
                    the pie chart clearly show which aspects of New York City are its best aspects. Looking at both the 
                    charts at the same time we clearly see the representation of the difference between both 
                    city’s quality of living. Ultimately, I believe that my representation was successful 
                    but could be much better moving forward.

                    The communication of my graphs basically just wanted to share the quality of various 
                    aspects of life within Johannesburg and New York City. I believe that my graph is 
                    successful in communicating which aspect of life each bar/segment represents and how good or bad 
                    that aspect is, however looking at my bar I cannot think of much else to say which just 
                    justifies my opinion that the graphs are boring and could be improved in future. Looking 
                    at the <i>Communicating Data to an Audience</i> reading we see that a infographic designer needs 
                    to keep two main questions in mind: “What does the audience know?”, and “What does the 
                    audience want?” (al., 2018). Keeping these in mind I decided which aspects I would include 
                    in my graphs (seeing that my API provides information on 17 different aspects of living 
                    in each city). I decided to include aspects that not only matter while living in each city, 
                    but also while just visiting them. I did this because I believe that people who do not live 
                    in these two cities would also be looking at the graphs and they would not exactly care 
                    about aspects such as: “Business Freedom”, “Start-ups”, or “Venture Capital”. I also thought 
                    that some of the most important aspects that audiences would want to know about were things 
                    like: “Safety”, “Commute”, “Tolerance”, and “Leisure & Culture”.

                    Ultimately, I feel that my charts are effective in communicating the information that I wanted 
                    to share. That being said I think that they could have been a bit more interesting if I could 
                    figure out how to use D3 more effectively. In future I will be sure to research more interesting 
                    ways to use D3 and SVG’s as well as look at more examples of data visualization.
